	* Release of pwgen 2.03

	* randnum.c: Fix #ifdef to use HAVE_DRAND48 instead of just
		RAND48.  This caused random() to be callled without first
		initializing the right random number generator.  This
		apparently caused pwgen to core dump under AIX, which
		seems surprising.

	* pw_rand.c (pw_rand): Use a list of acceptable characters instead
		of a list of unacceptable characters.  This is slightly
		faster, and the code is cleaner and easier to understand.

	* randnum.c (get_random_fd): Use random() instead of rand() since
		we initialize the random number generator using srandom() if
		/dev/urandom and drand48() are not present.

	* Makefile.in (pwgen): Use LDFLAGS when linking pwgen.

	* pw_phonemes.c (pw_phonemes): Fix bug in how we call 
		pw_random_number() so that we generate passwords that
		start with vowels, and insert numbers from 0-9, not just
		0-8.  (Oops!)  Addresses Debian bug #176688.

	* Makefile.in (install): Create the directory using $mandir, and
		not $(prefix)/man.

	* pw_phonemes.c: Add missing #include of string.h

2002-07-15  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Release of pwgen 2.02

	* pwgen.c (main): If the number of characters is less than 5,
		force the use of the fully random generator, since the
		quality of phonetic generator is really bad if the lengths
		are small --- and if the length is less than or equal to
		2, pwgen will loop forever.  (Addresses Debian bug #117137)

	* pw_rand.c: Add most punctuation characters to the "bad
		characters list", so that the random passwords are much
		more usable.

	* pwgen.1: Fix e-mail address in man page.  (Addresses Debian bug
		#150579)

	* Makefile.in (WALL_OPTS): Add gcc options to do lots of nit-picky
		checking.

	* pwgen.c, pw_phonemes.c, pw_rand.c, pwgen.c, pwgen.h, randnum.c:
		Add const declarations and other code cleanups for
		avoidining -Wall warnings.

	* pwgen.c, pw_rand.c: #include the appropriate header files to
		avoid -Wall warnings.  (Addresses Debian bug #126774).

	* pwgen.c (main): Fix floating point exception errors if the
		password is longer than terminal width.  Addresses Debian
		bug #113571.

	* pwgen.c (main): Return an exit value of 0 when pwgen on
		success.  (Addresses Debian bugs #118181 and #102063).

2001-06-19  Theodore Tso  <tytso@valinux.com>

	* Release of pwgen 2.01

	* pwgen.c (usage): Add help/usage message
