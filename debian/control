Description: Automatic Password generation
 pwgen generates random, meaningless but pronounceable passwords.
 These passwords contain either only lowercase letters, or upper
 and lower case mixed, or digits thrown in.
 Uppercase letters and digits are placed in a way that eases
 remembering their position when memorizing only the word.
